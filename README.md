Here we are Playing with Computer Vision using Python Libraries such as Open Cv and Numpy

We also use the Concept of Colour Detection to Convert BGR to HSV
The HSV model describes colors similarly to how the human eye tends
to perceive color.
RGB defines color in terms of a combination of primary colors.

'Hue' represents the color
'Saturation' represents the amount to which that respective color is
mixed with white
'Value' represents the amount to which that respective color is
mixed with black (Gray level).

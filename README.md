# Invisible-Cloak
Here we are Playing with Computer Vision using Python Libraries such as Open Cv and Numpy

ALGORITHM:
* Firstly we have to Capture the image from Webcam and Store the Background Frame
* Convert the BGR value to HSV value of Red Colour(You can use any colour that you want)
* Doing Colour Detection Processing
* And use cv2.imshow() method to read the Output 

We also use the Concept of Colour Detection to Convert BGR to HSV
The HSV model describes colors similarly to how the human eye tends
to perceive color.
RGB defines color in terms of a combination of primary colors.

'Hue' represents the color
'Saturation' represents the amount to which that respective color is
mixed with white
'Value' represents the amount to which that respective color is
mixed with black (Gray level).
